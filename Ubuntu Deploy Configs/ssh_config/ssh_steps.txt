TO use key based authentification

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
Can use a password to protect the private key.

Pub key and private key is genetrated at :
Your identification has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.


Then copy pub key to server using ssh-copy-id (included in most distributions):
ssh-copy-id username@remote_host -p 37925

To use the utility, you simply need to specify the remote host that you would like to connect to 
and the user account that you have password SSH access to. 
This is the account where your public SSH key will be copied, under ~/.ssh/.
To disable password authotification
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
PasswordAuthentication no
UsePam no
